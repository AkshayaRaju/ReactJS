Event propagation across multiple components can be made easy using
1. ContextAPI - Publish subscribe model
2. Redux - Centralised State Store.

1. ContextAPI
    Publish subscribe model
    Works only when the components involved are nested within one another.
    Create a Context, ContextProvider and ContextConsumer for every interaction. Each interaction can deal with only one value.

2. REDUX
    Centralised State Store
    Action -> Event
    Payload -> Argument
